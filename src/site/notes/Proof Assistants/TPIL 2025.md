# Theorem Proving in Lean

---

**PhD course**  
7.5 credits  
Study period 3, Jan-Mar 2025  
Chalmers University of Technology  
University of Gothenburg  

### Teaching Team

**Lecturer (course-responsible)**: [Mario Carneiro](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~marioc/)  
**Examiner** (PhD): [Magnus Myreen](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~myreen/)  
**Examiner** (Masters: [DAT235](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=39064)/[DIT577](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT577)): [Ana Bove](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/bove/)

### Purpose

This is a PhD course on the [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) interactive theorem prover. It has seen increased use in industry as a formal verification tool, as well as in the mainstream mathematics community as a tool for stating definitions and checking theorems. The goal will be to gain familiarity with the system and learn how to use it to do mathematics and formal verification.

On completion of this course, students are expected to have learned:

- How to write definitions and specifications in Lean
- How to write proofs in Lean using tactics
- Basic metaprogramming in Lean
- How to plan and develop a proof formalization project
- How to communicate about mathematical formalizations

This is a project course where students work either individually or in pairs on projects in the Lean interactive theorem prover. Early in the course there will be general introductory lectures about Lean. Once the students have settled into their projects, the lectures will become weekly project status reporting meeting and troubleshooting sessions.

### Prerequisites

Students must have prior courses on functional programming and on logic.

#### For PhD Students

Organization is informal, come to the first lecture and we can go from there.

#### For Masters Students

This course is primarily intended for PhD students, but Masters students with a suitable backgrounds are most welcome too.

For masters students, this is an instance of _Research-oriented course in Computer Science and Engineering_ (Chalmers: [DAT235](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=39064), GU: [DIT577](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT577)) with [Ana Bove](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/bove/) as examiner. Contact Ana Bove if you would like to be registered to this course. Note that you may not take the class for credit if you already have a result for this course code DAT235/DIT577 (e.g. from a previous iteration of the course).

Masters students that would like to be registered to this course need to have completed:

- A course in functional programming, for example
    - [TD555/DIT441](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/31081/assignments/syllabus) Introduction to functional programming, or
    - [TDA452/DIT143](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/31952/assignments/syllabus) Functional programming
- [DAT060/DIT203](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/30845/assignments/syllabus) Logic in computer science, or equivalent

### Examination and Grading

The course will be examined in two parts: (1) the code will be reviewed by the teacher and examiner, (2) the students need to present their project orally to fellow students.

The grading scale for Masters students is:

- 3: the work shows understanding of interactive theorem proving with Lean and ability to do independent work in Lean; the oral presentation needs to be of acceptable quality.
- 4: beyond the requirements of 3, for grade 4 students must shows significant independent work in Lean and the presentation must explain the work clearly.
- 5: beyond the requirements of 4, for grade 5 the work needs to consist of substantial independent work in Lean and an insightful or otherwise impressive presentation.

For a PhD student to pass, the PhD student must achieve at least grade 4.

### Schedule

Lectures in EDIT Anaylsen 13:00-14:45 on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting 28 Jan 2025. The course finishes during exam week of Study Period 3, i.e., 21 March 2025.
