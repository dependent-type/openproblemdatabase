- **Objective:**  
    To derive and ultimately solve the fundamental equation that describes the evolution of the entire universe.

- At first glance, modeling the entire universe may seem even more daunting than, for example, predicting the weather a week from now on Earth—something known to be notoriously difficult.

- However, at very large (cosmic) scales, and especially as we look back in time (to the early universe), the universe becomes increasingly smooth and homogeneous.
        
- By averaging over all small-scale complexities, the overall description of the universe is drastically simplified.

- **Key Insight:**
    - On these scales, the universe can be characterized by a **single function of time**.
        
    - The evolution of this function is governed by a **differential equation**, which we will derive in this lecture.

Thus, while the microscopic physics is complex, the mathematics governing the large-scale evolution of the universe is surprisingly straightforward.

### Historical Context

- The story of the expanding universe, at the **observational level**, begins in **1929** with **Edwin Hubble’s discovery** of a relationship between the velocities and distances of galaxies.

### Hubble’s Original Data and Methods

- **Hubble’s Plot:**
    
    - Plotted the **velocity** of individual galaxies (**y-axis**, measured in kilometers per second, km/s) against their **distance** (**x-axis**, measured in “megaparsecs”).
        
    - **Parsec (pc):** Astronomical distance unit; 1 parsec ≈ 3.26 light years; 1 megaparsec = 1 million parsecs.
        
    - The use of megaparsecs may seem unusual, but it’s standard in astronomy.
        
- **Data Collection:**
    
    - **Velocity measurements**: Obtained from redshift data provided by another astronomer (notably Slipher).
        
    - **Distance measurements:**
        
        - Hubble used **Cepheid variable stars** within galaxies.
            
        - Cepheids provide a measure of **absolute luminosity**.
            
        - By comparing **apparent luminosity** (as observed) and **absolute luminosity** (known from Cepheid properties), he could infer **distances** to galaxies.
            
    - **Note:**
        
        - Measuring **velocities** (via redshift) is relatively easy.
            
        - **Distance measurement** in cosmology remains challenging and debated even today.
            

### The Hubble Law

- **Initial Results:**
    
    - Hubble’s original 1929 plot (left side of the referenced figure) showed a **correlation**: galaxies with higher velocities tend to be farther away.
        
    - The correlation wasn’t striking with the original (limited) dataset.
        
- **Further Data (1932):**
    
    - Additional measurements (red points in later plots), at greater distances and higher redshifts, revealed a much clearer **linear relationship** between galaxy velocity and distance.
        
- **Formulation:**
    
    - Hubble formalized this as the **Hubble Law**: $$
v=H_0 d
$$where $v$ is galaxy velocity, $d$ is distance, and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant (the slope of the line).

**Key Takeaway:**  
Hubble’s work provided the first strong observational evidence that the universe is **expanding**—the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is receding from us.
